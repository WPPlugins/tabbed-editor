Changes the editor screen into a tabbed interface for copywriters

== Description ==

Too many boxes on the right of your editor? Don't like the single column interface because you have to scroll down too much? Just want to write?

This simple but effective plugin rearranges the editor page. It puts the publish box to the top and creates a tabbed interface. The first tab contains the editor and the second one all the meta boxes. No more mess. Just write.

There are no settings. Just activate and forget. Deactivate to return to the default editor interface.
